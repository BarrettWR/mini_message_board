# mini_message_board

This project is the first full stack application I have created - it uses Express, Node, Mongoose, Pug, and Tailwind to create a mini message board where you can post short messages. 

It is a one page application that can pull from and push to a MongoDB database in order to display messages submitted by users.

The live page can be seen here - https://mini-message-board-jvf9.onrender.com/

Note that the page will take ~30 seconds to initially load due to being hosted on a free tier at onrender.
